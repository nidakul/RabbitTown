Rabbit Town is an endless runner game developed with Unity 2D. The character runs towards the right side throughout the game. It doesn't require any player input to keep moving forward. The rabbit character tries to collect carrots to earn points. Each carrot is worth 1 point. The rabbit should try to progress by overcoming obstacles that come in its way. If the rabbit collides with any of these obstacles, it will die, and the user will be presented with a game over panel. The user can view both the current score and the high score in this section. If desired, the player can navigate to the main menu panel by pressing the menu button or restart the game by selecting the restart option. 
The user can make the character jump by pressing the spacebar. If the user presses the spacebar twice, it performs a double jump. While the character is in the air, the user can make the character fall faster by pressing the down arrow key. Additionally, when the character is on a platform, the user can make the character descend from the platform by pressing the down arrow key.
The game can be played on Android mobile devices.
